Linked data can be used in semantic web applications by linking every piece of data together based on existing Ontology or custom defined URIs. Some of the datasets are DBpedia for Wikipedia information, FOAF for describing persons and GeoNames for geographical data. Linked data can be used inside this cinema application by specifying cinema, movie and screens as subjects; having title, screen name and usher as predicate and the value of this information as objects.
